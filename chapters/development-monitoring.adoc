= Monitoring & logging

Logging and monitoring is essential for software, they business should always be
able to confirm software is functioning correctly.

[#259]
== {SHOULD} use dedicated logging library and logging levels

Logging directly to the console or command line is not recommended; it reduces
the effectivess of debugging, monitoring and checking the operational status of
the software. It increases the security risk because it is challenging to detect
if senstive data is being logged.

To effectively use the library logging levels (DEBUG, ERROR, NOTICE) should be
used.
